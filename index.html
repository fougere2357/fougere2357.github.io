        <p>War which comes from stupidity could cause seperation and distance between family members, this seperation makes the children to realize what they need and how hard it is to provide for themselves, activating their instinctual senses and creating an urge for Survival in any sense.</p>
        <br>
        <p id="zum">The will to live or Wille zum Leben is a concept developed by the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, Will being an irrational "blind incessant impulse without knowledge" that drives instinctive behaviors, causing an endless insatiable striving in human existence, which Nature could not exist without.

            This has nothing to do with the concept of the will to survive used in psychology, which is discussed further below in this article, since Schopenhauer was talking about the basic unit behind doing or thinking anything at all, not the basic drive behind running or fighting under life-threatening conditions (which in his terms would be a dissimulation of the mere blind striving for existence without goal, that is, a theatrical performance of Nature in its ever changing forms of matter).</p>

        <p>After Clemantine reached America and passed all those difficulties, she's evolved in ways that others around her haven't, she has seen how difficult life can be, so she still has one of her hands clinging to the past, subconsciously and because some people who don't understand her mock her.</p>
        <p>It has always been seen, that when someone thinks or sees the world differntly has been mocked, stoned and executed by society, Clementine experiences this kind of mocking in her school.</p>
